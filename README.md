# Rumble Stars Server
First open-source RumbleStars v1.10.0.1 server! [dudka servidor, based on PyRoyale by zzVertigo]<br>

## How to use?
pip install twisted

pip install pycryptodome

py main.py

### How to play?
To play you need custom client. You can change ip in libsmash_android.so with hex, use hosts or custom client. If you want to use custom client, you simply need to change ip in Frida-Gadget config (/lib/armeabi-v7a/libkitenok.config.so)
Download custom client: it's not released for now.
